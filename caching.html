<h2>Caching</h2>
<p>Using the in-memory cache with the client can <strong>massively</strong> increase
the speed a script can run. It accumulates a number of entities from REST API
calls so subsequent calls to retrieve these same entities need not pass through
to the API. This also has the effect to simplifying user code, as the script
can make the calls through the
<a href="apidocs/org.cruk.clarity.api/org/cruk/clarity/api/ClarityAPI.html"><code>ClarityAPI</code></a>
interface without worrying
about whether it already has some or all of the objects requested.</p>
<p>Like any client side caching, there are risks that an entity will be updated
from elsewhere while the client holds an earlier copy of the object. This
hasn't presented us much of a problem in EPP scripts (where this client is
used a lot) as these run from beginning to end and then stop, so the lifetime
of the cache is simply the duration of the script.</p>
<p>If used in a server environment, the cache can still be beneficial but it
may need to be tweaked so objects don't live as long in the cache. We've found
that most operations rarely hit the same objects from two different people
(though this is a risk) and the performance gain much outweighs the risk of
out of date information. The cache can be tuned or disabled as required by
the application.</p>
<p>The caching functionality has been moved out of the main client code into a separate
module with the update to version two of the client. This allows it to only be
included when it is wanted, which in turn saves the main client from having the
dependency on <em>Ehcache</em> . The cache artifact is <code>clarity-client2-cache</code>
and it is in the module <code>org.cruk.clarity.api.cache</code> .</p><section>
<h3>Enabling the cache</h3>
<p>The cache is essentially an aspect around the main <code>ClarityAPI</code>
implementation. It is configured with Spring and can be enabled for an
application by including the Spring configuration class
<a href="apidocs/org.cruk.clarity.api.cache/org/cruk/clarity/api/cache/spring/ClarityClientCacheConfiguration.html"><code>ClarityClientCacheConfiguration</code></a>
into the Spring context. No further configuration is necessary unless the
defaults need changing. The base client configuration class
<a href="apidocs/org.cruk.clarity.api/org/cruk/clarity/api/spring/ClarityClientConfiguration.html"><code>ClarityClientConfiguration</code></a>.
must also be present.</p></section><section>
<h3>Tuning the cache</h3>
<p>The cache is controlled by the definitions in the <code>ClarityClientCacheConfiguration</code>
class. There are some definitions for size and time of caches that are set in
this class; these give size (&#x201c;small&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;large&#x201d;) and time to live
(&#x201c;short&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;long&#x201d;) combinations. The actual caches for the various
entities of the API are defined in the method <code>clarityCacheManager</code>
that creates the cache manager bean.</p>
<p>One can change these default definitions by creating a subclass of
<code>ClarityClientCacheConfiguration</code>. One way to change the shape of the caches
as defined is to provide new combinations of the size and time to live definitions
in the subclass' constructor. The other is to override the <code>clarityCacheManager</code>
method to define a different cache manager. One would use the subclass in the Spring
application context instead of <code>ClarityClientCacheConfiguration</code> itself.</p>
<p>Have a look at the existing implementation of the <code>clarityCacheManager</code> method
for how to create the caches. The <em>Ehcache</em> documentation describes how it works
in its <a href="https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/getting-started.html" class="externalLink">&#x201c;Getting Started&#x201d;</a>
section.</p></section><section>
<h3>Bulk fetch, create and update operations</h3>
<p>Real world use has found that the bulk operations for fetching, creating
and updating objects from the API has a &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d; for the number of objects
in an operation. This is a number that minimises the request time per object.
For example, if one tries fetching 10,000 artifacts in one call to the
API's &#x201c;<code>.../artifacts/batch/retrieve</code>&#x201d; end point it will take longer than
making 20 calls for 500 artifacts (500 per call is the optimum number given
by Illumina, though testing has shown this can vary between installations).</p>
<p>As of release 2.22, the client library will batch bulk operations with
large numbers of objects into one or more calls to the relevant API end point
transparently to the user. So we can request our 10,000 artifacts in one call
to the client and let that fetch them in the most efficient manner.</p>
<p>The number of objects to retrieve or send in each batch can be tuned
with the <code>setBulkOperationBatchSize</code> method on the client. The default
is the recommended 500 per call to the API.</p></section></section><section>
<h2>Artifacts and their state parameter</h2>
<p>The <code>Artifact</code> class provides some complication to the cache by
always having a <em>state</em> parameter attached to its URIs. This means a given
artifact can be returned in different states depending on the state in the
URI.</p>
<p>The cache can be put in one of three modes for dealing with <code>Artifact</code> objects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li><code>EXACT</code>: The version of the artifact requested by the state
parameter must match the version in the cache exactly. If it is older or
newer than the cached version, the requested version is fetched and replaces
that already in the cache.</li>
<li><code>LATEST</code>: If the version of the artifact requested by the state
parameter is newer than the version in the cache, the requested version is
fetched and replaces the version in the cache. If it is the same version or
older, the newer version in the cache is returned.</li>
<li><code>ANY</code>: The cached version of the artifact is returned regardless
of the version requested by the state parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an artifact is requested without an explicit state in the URI, the
artifact in the cache is returned regardless of its version or the mode of
cache operation.</p>
<p>The default mode is <code>LATEST</code>, which is the way the cache behaved in
releases of the client before 2.22. Modes can be set on
the <code>clarityApiCacheAspect</code> bean using the <code>setStatefulBehaviour</code> method.</p><section>
<h3>Overriding the cache behaviour for a single fetch</h3>
<p>In actual use, the only time the state parameter is important for an
artifact is when one is looking for its QC flag value. No other fields have
a history that is preserved by the state: they are always their current database
value. Most of the time the cache behaviour is irrelevant, and the <code>LATEST</code>
or <code>ANY</code> cache behaviours are most suitable for the performance gain they
provide. This is not true when using the post process URI of the input/output
maps to obtain the QC flags.</p>
<p>The <code>overrideStateful</code> method of <a href="apidocs/org.cruk.clarity.api/org/cruk/clarity/api/ClarityAPI.html"><code>ClarityAPI</code></a>
allows a single call to be made through the API that will
fetch the artifact at either the exact version given in the URI or the latest
available state.</p>
<p>When <code>overrideStateful</code> is set to <code>EXACT</code>, the client will call
through to the Clarity API unless we already have exactly this version of the
artifact in the cache. As the call returns the cache follows its normal rules
for whether this version of the artifact is cached.</p>
<p>When <code>overrideStateful</code> is set to <code>LATEST</code>, the client will remove
the <em>state</em> parameter from the artifact's URI before always calling through
to the Clarity API. Again, as the call returns the cache follows its normal rules
for whether this version of the artifact is cached. If the client is again
instructed to fetch one of the artifact with this same override, the call will
go through to the Clarity API again.</p>
<p>The stateful override behaviour is only relevant to artifacts and is in place for
exactly one call to the API after the <code>overrideStateful</code> call. It will
always be cleared after the next call to the API, regardless of whether it
actually has an effect after that call (e.g. calling <code>overrideStateful</code>
and then <code>getServer</code> will cause the override to be cleared), so one
should put the call to <code>overrideStateful</code> immediately before the call to
<code>retrieve</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>loadAll</code> or <code>reload</code>. This behaviour is
local to the calling thread, so will not affect calls from other threads.</p></section></section></section>
