This project is record and playback wrappers for the Cambridge Research UK
Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI) Java client for Clarity's REST API.
</p>

<p>
It provides a means of recording Clarity API server messages to files,
which can then be used to provide a replay of those messages from the files.
This allows unit tests to be written that have real data but don't
change over time and can be run without access to the original server.
</p>

<p>
To use the record and playback wrappers, create a Spring application context
including the main client's configuration class
{@link org.cruk.clarity.api.spring.ClarityClientConfiguration} plus either
{@link org.cruk.clarity.api.record.spring.ClarityClientRecordConfiguration} for recording or
{@link org.cruk.clarity.api.playback.spring.ClarityClientPlaybackConfiguration} for play back.
