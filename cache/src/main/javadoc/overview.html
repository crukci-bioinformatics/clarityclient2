This project is the Cambridge Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI)
Java client for Clarity's REST API.
</p>

<p>
To use the client, create a Spring application context including the file
<code>org/cruk/clarity/api/clarity-client-context.xml</code>, from which
you can obtain the bean "<code>clarityAPI</code>". If you wish to use the
caching facility, also add the file
<code>org/cruk/clarity/api/clarity-cache-context.xml</code> to the
application context path.
