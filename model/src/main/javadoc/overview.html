This project is the Cambridge Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI)
Java client for Clarity's REST API.
</p>

<p>
This module contains the model classes originally generated from Genologics' XSD schema
documents. They are embellished with interfaces to distinguish between the
actual entities and the links to those entities. They are annotated with
JAXB annotations to allow that mechanism to marshal and unmarshal the XML
documents into Java objects.
</p>

<p>
The XSD files are packaged with this project: all rights to these belong
to Genologics (now Illumina).
